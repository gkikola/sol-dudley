\Exercise1 What are the orders of $3$, $5$, and $7$, modulo $8$?
\begin{solution}
  Since $3^2\equiv1\pmod8$, $5^2\equiv1\pmod8$, and
  $7^2\equiv1\pmod8$, we see that each of these residues has order
  $2$.
\end{solution}

\Exercise2 What order can an integer have (mod $9$)? Find an example
of each.
\begin{solution}
  Since $\phi(9) = 3\cdot2 = 6$, the possible orders are $1$, $2$,
  $3$, and $6$. $1$ is the only integer with order $1$. $8$ has order
  $2$ since $8^2\equiv 1\pmod9$. $4$ has order $3$ since
  $4^2 \equiv 7\pmod9$ and $4^3\equiv1\pmod9$. And $2$ has order $6$,
  since $2^2\equiv4\pmod9$ and $2^3\equiv8\pmod9$.
\end{solution}
